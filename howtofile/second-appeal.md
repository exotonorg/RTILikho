# Second Appeal

A Second Appeal is the remedy specified in the Section 19\(3\) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 that can be used in case:

1. The FAA or First Appellate Authority fails to furnish a reply to the First Appeal within a period of 30 days. 
2. The citizen is not satisfied with the response/decision of the FAA. 
3. The FAA acts in a manner that goes against the spirit of the RTI Act.

{% hint style="info" %}
 The Second Appeal is always filed with either the SIC \(State Information Commission\) or CIC \(Central Information Commission\).
{% endhint %}

## Time Limits to file Second Appeal

90 days from the date you received or should have received the reply of the First Appeal from the FAA.

## Address of Second Appellate Authority

1. If your RTI was filed with a central Public Authority like SBI, Prime Minister's office, Home Ministry etc you should file the Appeal with CIC. The most recent address of the CIC is **CIC Bhawan, Baba Gangnath Marg, Munirka, New Delhi - 110067** as given [here](http://cic.gov.in/contact). ****
2. If your RTI was filed with a state Public Authority like Municipal Corporation, Transport Office etc you can file the Second Appeal with either the SIC of the respective state or the CIC. However only one must be chosen and you cannot file the Appeal with both of them. The addresses of the SICs can be found at their respective websites as listed [here](http://rti.gov.in/rti/states.asp).

{% hint style="info" %}
Every state has their own SIC. However there is only a single CIC for all of India.
