# First Appeal

A First Appeal is the remedy specified in the Section 19\(1\) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 that can be used in case:

1. The PIO fails to furnish the requested information within a period of 30 days. 
2. The information provided is incorrect or deemed unsatisfactory by the citizen. 
3. You are a 3rd party consulted by PIO during the process of an application as the information might relate to you, but wish to appeal against the information disclosure due to privacy concerns. 
4. The PIO acts in a manner that goes against the spirit of the RTI Act. For e.g charging excessive fee for disclosing the information.

{% hint style="info" %}
 A First Appeal is submitted to a FAA or First Appellate Authority who is a designated officer higher in rank to the PIO.
{% endhint %}

## Time Limits to file First Appeal

30 days from the date you received or should have received the reply of the RTI application from the PIO.

## Address of FAA

If you received some form of a response from the PIO, the name and address of the First Appellate Authority is usually provided at the end of the reply.  
If the address is not provided in the PIO’s response or you never received a response in the first place, visit the website of the Public Authority your application refers to and search for the RTI section. Every Public Authority provide the details of the PIOs and FAAs on their websites.

Note that you should use the designation & not the name of the FAA while addressing the application i.e Use First Appellate Authority & not Mr. Mukesh Sharma.
